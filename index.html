<h1>Portland Fence Fines</h1>

<div id="fine">(calculating)</div>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
    On July 23, 2020 Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) sent a Cease &amp; Desist demand to the federal troops occupying Portland, ordering the removal of a fence illegally blocking a downtown bike lane.
</p>
<p>
    The feds not only didn't remove it, they didn't even respond.
</p>
<p>
    The City of Portland is fining the Federal Government $500 every 15 minutes the fence remains up. The counter above shows how much they currently owe Portland, and Portland has every intention on collecting.

<p>
    This is one of many actions taken against this illegal federal occupation since they arrived &mdash; uninvited and unwelcome &mdash; in Portland on July 4, 2020. Since their arrival to ostensibly protect a federal building, they have brutally assaulted nonviolent protesters every night. Using chemical weapons, "less-lethal" munitions, and stun grenades, these feds have consistently violated Portland citizens' constitutional right to assemble. They have injured many protesters, causing many to need hospitalization and surgery. Some are permanently disfigured due to their brutal tactics.

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
    <li><code>2020-07-29, 11:46</code> : Updated with a more accurate start time, based on Removal Notice sign. Fancy LCD Font.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>
    The source code and design documents live <a href="https://github.com/BrianEnigma/pdxfence">on GitHub as <code>pdxfence</code></a>.
    Check the readme file file there for the specific reasoning used to backsolve the T-0 (origin time) from which we
    start accumulating fees. <s>The project also includes a plea to folks that may know better for a more accurate
    cease-and-desist time.</s>
